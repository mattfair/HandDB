#HandDB
> HandDB allows you to manage poker hand ranges for many different scenarios to allow you to develop optimal poker playing strategies using poker theory. 

##About
HandDB is a AngularJS (https://angularjs.org/) webapp generated from the Yeoman generator for AngularJS Fullstack (https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) and a Node.js (http://nodejs.org/) back-end.

The purpose of this application is to have an organized way to manage hand ranges and analyze your poker play for many different scenarios so that you can develop optimal play strategies using poker theory.  This trys implements the ideas presented by Matthew Janda in his book [Applications of No-Limit Hold em](http://amzn.com/1880685558) and Ed Miller in his book [Poker's 1%: The One Big Secret That Keeps Elite Players On Top](http://amzn.com/1496159187).  These books have been huge for me to illuminate how to approach the game from a theoretical perspective, but I needed a better way to organize my thoughts.  Thus, this web-app.
